Overview
********

This sample is a simple socket application showing usage of UDP sockets over 802.15.4.

Building and Running
********************
When the application is run, it opens a packet socket and prints the length of the packet it receives. After that it sends a dummy packet every 5 seconds.

Preparation
***********

* Install Wireshark from wireshark.org
* Install the 802.15.4 sniffer plugin using `the following instructions <https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_sniffer_802154/UG/sniffer_802154/installing_sniffer_802154.html>`_
* `Configure the sniffer for Thread <https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_sniffer_802154/UG/sniffer_802154/configuring_sniffer_802154_thread.html>`_
*

Tasks
*****
* The sample has a shell. You can type `help` to see what is available. `OpenThread CLI reference might also be useful <https://github.com/openthread/openthread/blob/main/src/cli/README.md>`_. Note that you need to prefix openthread commands with `ot`.
* Is your device connected to the network? You can check that using `ot state`.
* Check the IP addresses that you device has. You can use `net iface` shell command to do that. What addresses does your device have?
* Check the neighbor table. You can use `ot neighbor table` shell command to do that. What devices are in the neighbor table?
* Check the router table. You can use `ot router table` shell command to do that. What devices are in the router table? Can you identify any devices in the router table that are not in the neighbor table?
* You can ping the whole network using one of the multicast addresses. For example, try `ff02::1` or `ff03::1`. Use `net ping` command to do that. Can you explain the difference between the addresses?
* The program opens a UDP socket at port 1234. Modify the program to send back a message to a received packet. This could be for example sensor readings or a simple message if you don't have a sensor. You can use `sendto` function to send a packet back to the sender.
* Use `ot udp open` and `ot udp send` commands to send a packet to another device. Use an address that you have discovered in previous steps. What did the peer device replied back? Can you identify the packet in Wireshark?
